          <h2 class="subtitle">What inpires you?</h2>
          <p class="para-text">
            What inspires people is deeply individual and can come from a wide
            range of sources. Whether it's finding inspiration in the beauty of
            nature, the achievements of others, or the pursuit of personal
            growth and fulfillment, the key is to remain open to the world
            around you and to seek out experiences that resonate with your own
            values, aspirations, and dreams.
          </p>

            <li>
              <b>Nature:</b> The beauty and wonder of the natural world can be
              incredibly inspiring. From majestic mountains to serene lakes,
              from vibrant sunsets to delicate flowers, nature has a way of
              stirring the soul and evoking a sense of awe and wonder.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Human Achievement:</b> Stories of perseverance, triumph over
              adversity, and acts of kindness and compassion can inspire people
              to strive for greatness and make a positive difference in the
              world. Whether it's overcoming personal challenges or achieving
              remarkable feats, the resilience and courage of the human spirit
              can be a powerful source of inspiration.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Role Models:</b> People who embody qualities such as integrity,
              courage, compassion, and determination can serve as inspiring role
              models for others. Whether they're historical figures, public
              figures, or everyday heroes in our own lives, the example set by
              these individuals can motivate others to strive for excellence and
              live with purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Personal Growth:</b> The journey of self-discovery and personal
              growth can be a deeply inspiring experience. Whether it's pursuing
              new interests, overcoming fears, or achieving personal goals, the
              process of self-improvement and self-realization can inspire
              individuals to live authentically and pursue their passions with
              conviction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Art and Creativity:</b> Whether it's music, literature, visual
              arts, or performing arts, creative expression has the ability to
              touch people's hearts and minds in profound ways. Artistic works
              that evoke emotion, provoke thought, or convey powerful messages
              can inspire individuals to explore their own creativity and find
              meaning in their lives.
